"""PostToolUse(Bash) hook: when a command was moved to the background, hand the model
the exact Monitor call that watches it, so arming a watcher is a yes/no instead of
four decisions (pattern, buffering, timeout, exit condition).

Fires only when `tool_response.backgroundTaskId` is present (explicit
run_in_background, or auto-backgrounded at the sync timeout). Subagents are skipped:
they receive neither completion notifications nor Monitor events.

Which file to watch: if the command redirects stdout to a file (`> job.log 2>&1`), that
file — the first whowill A/B (2026-09-14) showed every instance re-pointing the hint at
the job's own log when the hint named the harness task file. Otherwise the harness task
output file, which isn't in the hook payload: it is
<tmp>/claude-<uid>/<cwd slug>/<session_id>/tasks/<task_id>.output, located by glob so a
slug-rule change can't silently break the hint (falls back to the computed path).

# The `monitor-undefer.py` patch (https://github.com/Butanium/claude-code-patches)
# flips that flag, and then the line is dead text plus a nudge toward a call the
# model does not need. These two byte strings are the patch's own PATTERN and
# PATCHED constants, so a patch that still applies cannot disagree with this
# check; `shouldDefer:!0` alone has ~46 copies in the binary, hence the
# neighbouring property names, which are structural and survive minification.
