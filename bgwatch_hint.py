"""PostToolUse(Bash) hook: when a command was moved to the background, hand the model
the exact Monitor call that watches it, so arming a watcher is a yes/no instead of
four decisions (pattern, buffering, timeout, exit condition).

Fires only when `tool_response.backgroundTaskId` is present (explicit
run_in_background, or auto-backgrounded at the sync timeout). In-process teammates are
skipped: while idle they are not re-woken by their own notifications, so a watcher's events
would wait in the lead's queue. Subagents do get the hint: on 2.1.280 they have Monitor and a
Monitor event re-invokes an idle subagent (probed 2026-09-25: the `[bgwatch]` banner and a
`[match]` each woke a haiku subagent that had ended its turn).

Which file to watch: if the command redirects stdout to a file (`> job.log 2>&1`), that
file — the first whowill A/B (2026-09-14) showed every instance re-pointing the hint at
the job's own log when the hint named the harness task file. Otherwise the harness task
output file, which isn't in the hook payload: it is
<tmp>/claude-<uid>/<cwd slug>/<session_id>/tasks/<task_id>.output, located by glob so a
slug-rule change can't silently break the hint (falls back to the computed path).

Linux-only: `held_open` and `already_watched` read /proc. Elsewhere they answer False, so an
auto-backgrounded command never gets its deferred hint; explicit launches are unaffected.
